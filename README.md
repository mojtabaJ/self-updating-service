# Self Updating Service

This repository contains three Spring Boot projects that demonstrate a self-updating mechanism for a client application:

1. **update-server**: Hosts the latest version information and JAR files.
2. **client-app**: The client application that needs to be updated.
3. **update-runner**: Checks for updates, downloads new versions of `client-app`, and runs the updated version.
